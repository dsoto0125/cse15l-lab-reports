nothing happens because it was not given a directory and when it is already in a directory, it returns the code back to the home directory

where it simply gives us a list of directories in the current directory

It gives the user the name of the directory that was inputted and simply returns them to the current directory

`cat` when given an arguement simply returns said arguement's internal code, just as it would return a typed text or folder

`cat` returns the directory you input in the arguement and reminds us that this is a directory, not a file or text
