## Lab report 5
### part 1
**user:Cheese4995**
Hello,
I followed all the instructions on the lab for lab7 and I am still getting an error message on my tests. I wrote all the tests right but it is exitting with an error. It says initialization error but I am not sure where it could be or what it could be. I followed the instructions and even looked at friend's lab and it still doesn't work.
Please help, thank you!

Hi, your file seems to be running into an innitialization error, please check that all your files are correctly written and that nothing is misspelled or in the wrong place. Any changes such as a missing semi-colon, an extra bracket, or an incorrect decleration of a file could be the cause of the error in your code.

Hi,
I tried re-looking at all my code in ListExamples.java and ListExamplesTests.java and found that I wasn't incorrect anywhere in my files, however I did find that I changed the bash script by accident when I was trying to fix my code earlier. Thank you for identifying different options for my error!

### bug fix
I simply changed the test script as many people often look for problems in their code not realising that it is not limited to what they did. Perhaps without realizing(I do this a lot personally), they changed a file destination or test destination in the autograder while testing something else and forget what the original test method was like.

### part 2
**What I learned**
I learned lots of things during second quarter, things such as autograder scripts and how they works, vim, jdb, and how to work with servers. I had no idea how people worked with servers before hand and learning how to use things such as vim and edit urls really made me feel like one of those hackers
in the movies. Especially when I would work on these things infront of non-computer majors and they would say how it looks like I'm hacking into something.It was really hard to learn from labs during the second half of the quarter because everything started ramping up but I would ask the tutors or lab mates 
what might be wrong or how should I start and everyone was happy to help. The autograder topics are still incredibly confusing to me but I do have some understanding of how they work and why the function in grading people's code. I couldn't write one but I can understand how it is testing someone's files.
I think my favorite thing that I learned was jdb and vim. I feel really comfortable with using vim and jdb to push changes and create interesting uses of servers and their files. I think it's great so thank you!
