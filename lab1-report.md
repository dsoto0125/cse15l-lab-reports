The command `cd` run by itself will automatically return to the home directory, even if you were already inside of another directory at the time of typing it. Anytime that the command points towards a file path that is not a directory, it will return an error message stating different things depending on the situation i.e. putting in the wrong name and it returning that no such file or directory with that name exists.

This time with the use of a file as an arguement when running the command of `cd`, it simply reminds us that it is not a directory and bash(error) to my knowledge is telling us that this is not the most efficient use of this command.This output is not an error.

when typing `ls` with an arguement such as a filepath in this example, will return the name of the file. With a directory as an arguement, it will return filepaths and directories within it. This kind of output is not an error.

`cat` when given an arguement simply returns said arguement's internal code, just as it would return a typed text or folder.This is not an error output.

`cat` returns the directory you input in the arguement and reminds us that this is a directory, not a file or text.This is an error output as it expects a file to print.
